README:
In the notebook pca_autoencoder_morphometrics.ipynb we use dimensionality reduction algorithms as a previos step for further analysis of geometric morphometrics landmarks on the skulls of male egyptian mummies.

The dataset was acquired through CT-scans and also by means of microscribe devices.
