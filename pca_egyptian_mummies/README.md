## COMPARISON OF PCA ALGORITHMS

<h4>Status of test on push:</h4>

[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/dashnisan/ml_diverse_projects/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dashnisan/ml_diverse_projects/actions/workflows/main.yml)


In the notebook **pca_autoencoder_morphometrics.ipynb** we compare different dimensionality reduction algorithms (which serve as a previous step for further analysis) on the spatial coordinates of morphometric landmarks on the skulls of egyptian mummies.

<ul>
  <li>PCA analytical (linear model)</li>
  <li>Kerne PCA  (non-linear)</li>
  <li>Autoencoder based PCA (linear): an equivalent of the analytical PCA using neural networks</li>
</ul>

The dataset was acquired through CT-scans and also by means of microscribe devices.
