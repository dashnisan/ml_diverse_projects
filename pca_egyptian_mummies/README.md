In the notebook pca_autoencoder_morphometrics.ipynb we compare different dimensionality reduction algorithms (which serve as a previous step for further analysis) on the spatial coordinates morphometric landmarks on the skulls of male egyptian mummies.

<ul>
  <li>PCA analytical (linear model)</li>
  <li>Kerne PCA  (non-linear)</li>
  <li>Autoencoder based PCA (linear): an equivalent of the analytical PCA using neural networks</li>
</ul>

The dataset was acquired through CT-scans and also by means of microscribe devices.
