In this repository you find diverse small to medium size machine projects and exercises I have finished:

<ul>
  <li> <strong>california_housing</strong>: a regression exercise using Scikit-Learn pipelines and the California Housing dataset. </li>
  <li> <strong>autoencoder_pca</strong>: comparison of linear-eigenvector-PCA, kernel PCA and an autoencoder with a single hidden layer and MSE as loss (equivalent to linear PCA). 
    The data used is an interesting set of morphometric landmarks of the skulls of <strong>egyptian mummies</strong>. Scikit-Learn and TensorFLow</li>
