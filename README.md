In this repository you find diverse small to medium size machine projects and exercises I have finished:

## california_housing
A regression exercise using Scikit-Learn pipelines and the California Housing dataset. 

## autoencoder_pca
comparison of linear-eigenvector-PCA, kernel PCA and an autoencoder with a single hidden layer and MSE as loss (equivalent to linear PCA). 
The data used is an interesting set of morphometric landmarks of the skulls of <strong>egyptian mummies</strong>. Scikit-Learn and TensorFLow
